Here is the **clean bullet-point version** of your Replit prompt.
No hashes, no headings, no special characters — just clear instructions.

---

• You are working inside the LifeOSv4 project (React, TypeScript, Vite, Firestore).
• Follow the existing file structure, contexts, modules, and coding style.
• Implement multi-account support. Each user may belong to one or more accounts.
• Create a currentAccount context.
• Store all module data under accounts/{accountId}/{moduleName}/...
• User document format:

* role: "super-admin" | "admin" | "user"
* accounts: array of accountIds

• Each account document contains:

* name
* members
* createdAt
* createdBy

• Add a Sharing Parameters screen in the settings module.
• The admin chooses per-module sharing mode: full, partial, private.
• Save sharing modes to accounts/{accountId}/settings/sharing.
• Implement module visibility rules based on sharing mode.

* full: all users see all items
* partial: users see their items plus items sharedWith them
* private: users only see their own items

• Add item-level fields for all modules:

* createdBy
* sharedWith array
* assignedTo (if applicable)

• Update Firestore queries so users only see items allowed by module sharing mode and item sharing rules.

• Implement user deletion flow.
• When deleting a user, show a confirmation dialog with three options:

* delete user and delete all their data
* delete user but keep their data
* export user data as JSON before deletion
  • If keeping data, mark items with createdBy set to "deleted-user" and ownedByUserWasDeleted set to true.
  • Super-admin cannot be deleted.
  • Admin cannot delete themselves.

• Add a timing system for groceries, purchases, and quick notes.
• Each item has two fields: urgency and dueDate.

* urgency may be: today, tomorrow, dayAfter, thisWeek, 30days, none, or date
  • Implement a function that converts urgency into a normalized dueDate.
  • Update item editors in groceries, purchases, and quick notes to include urgency options.
  • If user selects "Pick a date", allow a manual date selection.

• Integrate all modules with due dates into the dashboard.
• Create a unified task stream that merges:

* projects, tasks
* groceries
* purchases
* quick notes
* itineraries
* documents with expiration dates
* debts and credits with due dates
  • Sort items into the following dashboard sections:
* search
* today
* assigned to me
* upcoming
* no urgency

• Items assignedTo the current user appear in the "assigned to me" section.
• Items due today appear in "today".
• Items due tomorrow appear in "tomorrow".
• Items with later due dates go into "upcoming".
• Items with no dueDate go into "no urgency".

• In every module, add filtering options:

* All
* Mine
* Shared With Me
* Assigned To Me

• Each item shown in a module must display:

* created by
* shared with list
* assigned to (if applicable)

• Use existing components, modals, contexts, and Firestore service functions.
• Keep TypeScript strict typing.
• Do not restructure modules or routing.
• Integrate the new functionality into the existing architecture with minimal disruption.

• Begin implementing these changes throughout the LifeOSv4 codebase.
